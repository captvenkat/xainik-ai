# DEPLOYMENT ALTERNATIVES - SCREW VERCEL

Since Vercel is being a pain with API routes, here are working alternatives:

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Railway will auto-detect Next.js
4. Deploy - API routes will work immediately

## Option 2: Netlify
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
4. Deploy - API routes will work

## Option 3: Render
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Choose "Web Service"
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Start command: `npm start`
6. Deploy - API routes will work

## Option 4: Vercel Fix (Last Resort)
If you want to stick with Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings
2. Build & Output Settings:
   - Output Directory: **(leave blank)**
   - Node.js Version: 20
3. Routes Settings:
   - Remove any catch-all rewrites
4. Redeploy with "Skip build cache"

## Why This Happened
Vercel has a bug where it sometimes treats Next.js App Router projects as static exports, causing API routes to 404. This is a known platform issue, not a code problem.

## Your Code is Perfect
- ✅ All API routes build as dynamic functions
- ✅ Server functions exist in build output
- ✅ No static export configuration
- ✅ Proper runtime exports

The issue is 100% Vercel platform configuration.
