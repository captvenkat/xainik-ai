pnpm run master-runbook

# Run individual checks
pnpm run preflight
pnpm run self-check
pnpm run smoke:preview
pnpm run smoke:prod

# Test with preview URL
PREVIEW_URL=https://xainik-git-feature-branch.vercel.app pnpm run smoke:preview
```

### üìã Operator Checklist

### üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set System Prompt**: Copy the system prompt from `docs/BUILD_CAPTAIN_PROMPT.md` into Cursor
2. **Run Master Runbook**: Execute `TASK: master-runbook` to test the complete pipeline
3. **Configure Environment**: Ensure all required Vercel environment variables are set
4. **Test Pipeline**: Run through the complete deployment flow to validate everything works

The Build Captain system is now ready for production use with comprehensive validation, error handling, and rollback procedures.
