## 🎯 **CHANGE REQUEST**
Remove resume upload functionality from pitch creation, keeping only the resume request button for recruiters to request resumes from veterans.

## 🔧 **CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Pitch Creation Form (`src/app/pitch/new/ai-first/page.tsx`)**

#### **Removed Fields:**
- ✅ `resume_url?: string` - Resume file URL
- ✅ `resume_share_enabled: boolean` - Resume sharing toggle

#### **Updated Interface:**
```typescript
interface AIPitchFormData {
  title: string
  pitch_text: string
  skills: string[]
  job_type: string
  availability: string
  photo_url?: string
  web_link?: string  // LinkedIn/website link
  // REMOVED: resume_url, resume_share_enabled
}
```

#### **Updated Form State:**
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<AIPitchFormData>({
  title: '',
  pitch_text: '',
  skills: ['', '', ''],
  job_type: '',
  availability: ''
  // REMOVED: resume_share_enabled: false
})
```

#### **Updated Pitch Data Creation:**
```typescript
const pitchData = {
  user_id: user.id,
  title: formData.title.trim(),
  pitch_text: formData.pitch_text.trim(),
  skills: formData.skills.filter(skill => skill.trim()),
  job_type: formData.job_type,
  availability: formData.availability,
  location: profile.location,
  phone: profile.phone || '',
  photo_url: formData.photo_url,
  linkedin_url: formData.web_link,
  is_active: true
  // REMOVED: resume_url, resume_share_enabled
}
```

#### **UI Changes:**
- ✅ Removed resume upload section
- ✅ Disabled resume sharing checkbox
- ✅ Updated help text to indicate resume request functionality

### **2. Database Schema (`completely_safe_fix.sql`)**

#### **Updated Pitches Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.pitches (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid,
  title text NOT NULL,
  pitch_text text NOT NULL,
  skills text[] NOT NULL,
  job_type text NOT NULL,
  location text NOT NULL,
  availability text NOT NULL,
  phone text NOT NULL,
  photo_url text,
  linkedin_url text,  -- Added for LinkedIn/website links
  likes_count int DEFAULT 0,
  shares_count int DEFAULT 0,
  views_count int DEFAULT 0,
  endorsements_count int DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
  plan_tier text,
  plan_expires_at timestamptz,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
  -- REMOVED: resume_url, resume_share_enabled
);
```

### **3. Test Script (`scripts/test-pitch-creation.js`)**

#### **Updated Test Data:**
```javascript
const testPitch = {
  user_id: users.id,
  title: "Test Pitch - No Resume Upload",
  pitch_text: "This is a test pitch to verify that the database fix works correctly without resume upload functionality. Resume requests are now handled by recruiters.",
  skills: ["Testing", "Database Management", "Verification"],
  job_type: "Full-time",
  location: users.location || "Remote",
  availability: "Immediate",
  phone: users.phone || "+1-555-0000",
  linkedin_url: "https://linkedin.com/in/test-veteran",
  is_active: true
  // REMOVED: resume_url, resume_share_enabled
};
```

## 🎯 **RESUME REQUEST FUNCTIONALITY RETAINED**

- ✅ **Resume Request Button**: Recruiters can still request resumes from veterans
- ✅ **Resume Request System**: The backend resume request functionality remains intact

### **What Was Removed:**

- ❌ **Resume Auto-Sharing**: No automatic resume sharing with pitch creation
- ❌ **Resume URL Storage**: No resume file URLs stored in pitch data
