# Vercel API Routes 404 Diagnostic Report

## Issue Summary
All Next.js App Router API routes return 404 errors in production on Vercel, despite being properly built as server functions locally.

## Technical Details

### Project Configuration
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.5 with App Router
- **Deployment**: Vercel (GitHub integration)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/captvenkat/xainik-ai.git
- **Production URL**: https://xainik.com

### Build Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.mjs
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  experimental: { 
    appDir: true,
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['@prisma/client']
  },
  images: { formats: ['image/avif','image/webp'] }
};
```

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

### API Route Structure
All API routes are properly structured as:
```
app/api/health/route.ts
app/api/test/route.ts
app/api/bookings/confirm/route.ts
app/api/bookings/route.ts
```

### Runtime Exports
All API routes include:
```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs';
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
export const revalidate = 0;
```

## Evidence

### ‚úÖ Local Build Success
```bash
$ npm run build
‚úì Compiled successfully
‚úì Linting and checking validity of types
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages (37/37)
‚úì Collecting build traces
‚úì Finalizing page optimization

Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
‚îú ∆í /api/health                          0 B                0 B
‚îú ∆í /api/test                            0 B                0 B
‚îú ∆í /api/bookings/confirm                0 B                0 B
‚îú ∆í /api/bookings                        0 B                0 B
```

### ‚úÖ Server Functions Exist
```bash
$ npm run assert:server-functions
üîç Checking for server functions in build output...
‚úÖ Found server function: .next/server/app/api/health/route.js
‚úÖ Found server function: .next/server/app/api/test/route.js
‚úÖ Found server function: .next/server/app/api/bookings/confirm/route.js
‚úÖ Found server function: .next/server/app/api/bookings/route.js
‚úÖ All server functions found in build output!
üöÄ Ready for deployment with server functions.
```

### ‚ùå Production 404 Errors
```bash
$ curl -s https://xainik.com/api/health
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">...
<title>404: This page could not be found.</title>
```

### ‚úÖ Static Assets Work
- CSS, JS, images load correctly
- Main site pages work fine
- Only API routes return 404

## Troubleshooting Attempted

1. **Configuration Fixes**:
   - Removed any static export configurations
   - Added explicit runtime exports
   - Updated vercel.json with function runtime

2. **Route Structure**:
   - Verified no conflicting page.tsx files under /api
   - Confirmed proper route.ts handlers
   - Added comprehensive error handling

3. **Build Verification**:
   - Created CI assertion script to verify server functions
   - Confirmed all routes build as dynamic (∆í)
   - Verified server functions exist in build output

## Request for Support

This appears to be a Vercel platform-specific issue where:
- Build process completes successfully
- Server functions are correctly generated
- But Vercel runtime is not serving the API routes

**Questions for Vercel Support**:
1. Are there any known issues with Next.js 14.2.5 App Router API routes?
2. Could this be related to function region configuration?
3. Are there any account-specific settings that might affect API route deployment?
4. Should we try a different Node.js runtime version?

## Alternative Testing
Planning to test deployment on Netlify/Railway to confirm this is Vercel-specific.
